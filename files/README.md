# Gem Hunter 
Welcome to Gem Hunter 2.  Developed by Isaiah Harville, Joshua Payne, and Colin O'Kain.

Gem Hunter is a text-based adventure game.  The goal of the game is to open all of the locked doors to retrieve the Gemstones.
Once you have all of the Gemstones you can open the Gemstone Door and you beat the game. The game is filled with NPC's and challenges.
As you play, you are expected to draw a map to keep track of where youre going.  That is the biggest challenge of the game.  The player will always start in room 0, however the room names do not necessarily indicate the next room.  Your map should be drawn as you move in the game.
HINT: Room numbers really are not useful.
