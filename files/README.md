# Gem Hunter 
Welcome to Gem Hunter 2.  Developed by Isaiah Harville, Joshua Payne, and Colin O'Kain.

Gem Hunter is a text-based adventure game filled with NPC's and challenges.  The goal of the game is to open all of the locked doors to retrieve the Gemstones and
once you have all of the Gemstones you can open the Gemstone Door.  After opening your Gemstone door, and searching the room it leads to, you beat the game.
As you play, you are expected to draw a map to keep track of where youre going.  That is the biggest challenge of the game.  The player will always start in 
room 0, however the room names do not necessarily indicate the next room.  Your map should be drawn as you move in the game.
HINT: Room numbers really are not useful.  Searching rooms can help you find coins!
